# Register studies

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

Data utilised in register studies, often called as register-based data
or administrative data, typically consists of idâ€™s, time stamp variables
and codes describing different events. This package has been designed
specifically for handling of such data.

regstudies-package is based on tidyverse and examples utilise widely
tidyverse programming style. The functions are designed with ICD codes
in mind, but can be used with any kind of string formatted codes and are
thus not necessarily limited to healthcare data. Users are allowed to
make their own definitions of code classifiers, so the package suits
needs of different countries having their own code definitions of
disease codes for example.

Description: The data utilised in register studies, often called as register-based data or administrative data
  typically consists of time stamp variables and codes describing events. This package has been designed specifically for handling of such data. 
  The packages is based on tidyverse packages and examples utilise widely tidyverse programming style. 
  The functions are designed with ICD codes in mind but can be used with any kind of string formatted codes and are thus not
  necessarily limited to healthcare data. Users are allowed to make their own definitions of code classifiers, so the package
  suits needs of different countries having their own code definitions of disease codes for example.
